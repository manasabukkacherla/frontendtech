                  <p>Bangalore</p>
                  <p>I had to move to USA in 2023 because of my work with my family. A friend of mine referred me the services of Rentamigo as he was already using the same since last two years. I would definitely say they have been very helpful in managing my duplex house. I visited my house last year and are really impressed by the condition in which it has been maintained.</p>

                  <p>I appreciate their timely payment of rent and transparency in the maintaining of the accounts. I get the rent credited to my account and account statement in my mailbox every month unfailingly by 5th of the month.</p>

                  <p>Rentamigo manages my 3BHK located at Electronics City. Although my tenants couldn’t pay their rent for 2 consecutive months because of loss of job, which I empathize with, Rentamigo ensured that the rent is credited to my account. I came to know of this when they finally decided to vacate and I noticed the settlement statement that Rentamigo was shared with them.</p>

                  <p>I had rented a flat in Bellandur from Rentamigo. I never faced any issues from them and also they were very prompt in the refund of Security deposit when I vacated the flat.</p>

                  <p>I had rented a flat from Rentamigo along with my friends. When we moved in there were quite a few issues like pigeon mess and a seepage that occurred within 40 days of us moving in. however, Rentamigo attended to all the problems highlighted by us and they ensured that they were taken care of.</p>
